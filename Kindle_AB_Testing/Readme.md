## Project Overview:
Using a dataset from Kindle, A/B testing is done to determine which ad is more cost-effective. The first ad was designed to instill fear regarding the potential negative impacts on one's professional career if they don't read regularly. The second ad focused on the long-term professional benefits of regular reading and how Kindle can aid in this pursuit. The main objectives are to determine which ad was more successful in driving purchases and which ad garnered more clicks.

## Objectives: 
- Which ad is more cost-effective?
- Are certain demographic groups more responsive to the fear-based ad compared to the knowledge-based ad?
- How do the key metrics (clicks, conversions, cost per conversion) compare between the two campaigns?
- What factors might have contributed to the success or failure of each ad campaign?

## Outcomes: 
*In Progress* 
- There is a significant difference in the cost effectiveness of each ad

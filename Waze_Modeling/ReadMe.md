## Project Overview 
The project focuses on building and testing models using ride share data to predict customer churn. It involves data preprocessing, normalization, and the application of various statistical techniques to understand and visualize the data, followed by modeling and A/B testing to identify effective strategies for reducing churn.


## Objective
To predict customer churn in a ride share service by developing and testing different machine learning models after preprocessing and normalizing the dataset.

## Outcomes
The project outcomes include a normalized dataset, insights into data distributions through visualizations, identification of significant outliers, and the creation of predictive models for customer churn, please see notebook for all final numbers.

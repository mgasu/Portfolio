In this project, I have developed a web scraper to extract the raw, unformatted data from these published diaries. I then transform and clean the data before completing a thorough quantitative analysis, enabling deeper insights into the financial lives of the featured diarists.      | Data Mining, Python, Jupyter, Tableau, Webscraping, EDA, Transforming unformatted data, cleaning data, data visualization, quantitative analysis  |

Does a fear based ad, or a knowledge based ad work best? Which one is more cost effective? I perform exploratory analysis and create a predictive model with the goal to determine which ad will be more successful long-term | Python,  Python, pandas, generating meaningful metrics, two-proportion z-test |

# Project Overview and Outcomes

## Objective 
To gather and analyze financial data from Refinery 29's "Money Diaries" blog, 
where individuals share detailed reports on their income, debt, expenses, and spending habits over a week. With a goal to extract, clean, 
and transform this unstructured data into a format suitable for in-depth analysis, revealing patterns and insights into how people allocate 
their income across various expenses.

## What I wanted to learn from this data: 
- What percentage of income does the average person spend on rent? Do we still stick to the 36% rule?
- Do different industries tend to pay more in salary?
- In my world, financial transparency is a new thing, so what's the average age of someone who fills out a money diary? Does my idea of the younger generation being more open to sharing finance info hold true?

## Skills Used
- Web Scraping: Utilized Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to extract unformatted data from the Refinery 29 "Money Diaries" blog.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Employed Pythonâ€™s pandas library to clean, structure, and transform the raw data, making it suitable for analysis.
- Data Analysis: Performed statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns in the dataset, including average income, spending habits, and the proportion of income allocated to different expense categories.
- -Visualization: Created visual representations of the data using matplotlib and seaborn to clearly communicate key findings.
- Reporting: Compiled the analysis into a report highlighting key insights, such as average income, spending behavior, and industry trends.


## Outcomes 
- Average Income Across the US: ~$84k
- Average Age of Respondents: 28 years
- Average Spend as percentage of Yearly Income: 1.15% (or ~$750)
- Rent/Mortgage Spending as Percentage of Income: 36% (the general rule rings TRUE!) 
- Industry Insights: The most common industry among respondents was identified as Tech, indicating a potential trend in the financial habits of individuals within this sector. Respondents in this category on average had a higher salary than respondents not in Tech.
